            <h3>Software Development</h3>
            <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Jordan and I love learning about software development. 
              I began my coding journey several years ago by writing a simple 
              text-based game in python that I excitedly showed to several friends 
              (who mostly tried not to laugh at me). Since then, I have continued to 
              study coding by taking many online courses and completing Code Louisville, 
              a KentuckianaWorks program, for front end web development. 
              Through my work I have spent time developing skills in technologies such as:

                <li>CSS</li>

            </div>          
          
            <p>I plan to continue learning more about these languages and tools, 
              in addition to many more! If you are interested in working with me,
              please feel free to contact me!

            <h3>Music</h3>
             <p>
                In addition to my journey in becoming to a software devloper, I have also spent time as a professional musician. As 
                a performer, I have been a member of the Huntsville Symphony Orchestra since 2014 and played with organizations such 
                as the Louisville Orchestra, the Nashville Symphony, and the Indianapolis Symphony. In addition, I have been lucky
                enough to be involved in studio recordings for video games such as Halo Infinite, Destiny 2, and Call of Duty.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a Teacher, I have worked with hundreds of students through public school systems in Kentucky and Indiana, and have 
                maintained my own private teaching practice. My students have gone on to do well in local auditions / programs, and 
                at a national level for college auditions. I have also spent time helping organize educational events
                for young musicians through the University of Louisvile.

              In additional to my professional activities, I also love spending time running, biking, listening to podcasts,
              reading books (particularly fantasy series by authors like Brian McClellan and John Gwynne), nerding out over video games,
              and scouring local brewries for interesting beer!

                <h4>The problems:</h4>
                <p>1. I needed a final project for the Code Louisville Web-Development Program</p>
                <p>2. In my time playing StarCraft2, I found the exisiting practice tools for 
                  working on builds to be lacking. I wanted to have something I could use at anytime
                  to practice a build that was easily accessible via the web. Current tools, that 
                  I found, required users to be in specific pre-made custom modes, or didn't provide
                  an interacive interface with timings. 
                </p>

                <h4>Features:</h4>

                <ul>

                  <li>Uses webworkers to handle hundreds of timings for different objects</li>
                  <li>Allows input of custom JSON data structure to import builds from accompanying project</li>

                <h4>Project Goals:</h4>
                <p>While building the StarCraft2 Buildinator, I found that the project worked well for
                  simple builds that may have only had a handful of items a user wanted to use. However, 
                  I wanted to be able to automate the process a bit and to be able to analyze games from
                  more advanced players.

                <h4>The Problem:</h4>

                <p>When the PlayStation 5 first released, it was nearly impossible to get one. Scalpers, bots, and avid fanpeople all wanted to get one. 
                  In fact, as of August 2022, it still seems difficult to be able to purchase one at MSRP. My partner is a big PlayStation fan and she 
                  really wanted to get one, so I wrote this little project to help.</p>
